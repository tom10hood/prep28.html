    <h1> Data scientist vs. Computer scientist</h1> 
    <p>The difference between a data scientist and a computer programmer is their point of view and range of abilities. A programmer is not a data scientist if they know how to run a doop. Data scientists often need technical skills and domain skills. Most data scientists have technical skills including mathematics, statistics and programming. They also have domain skills such as in the industry their in, an example of this would be understanding customer purchasing behavior if you were working for amazon. Data scientist find new discoveries with data by obtaining a data set, and creating visual representations of the data and interpreting them, or by using advanced algorithms to search the data for new discoveries. The difference is a computer scientist only needs to know how to program, while data scientists need knowledge of how to maniple they data, and have the statistical skills to recognize trends within the data to discover new things.

    <h2>Inner Join</h2> 
    <p> Inner join selects keyword records that have matching values in different tables. To break the command down it works in 4 parts select, from, inner join and ON. The select, selects what columns you want to see: SELECT column name.columnID, Customers.CustomerName. The FROM identifies the first table you want to work off of. The INNER JOIN references the second table you want to work off of. Finally, the ON wraps it all up, it references the two columns you would like printed in visible format.an example of this is orders.CustomerID = customers.CustomerID; this would then makeÂ  OrderIDs and customer names from overlapping tables visible.
